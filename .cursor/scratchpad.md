# Frontend Reorganization Plan

## Background and Motivation
The frontend codebase needs to be reorganized to improve maintainability, readability, and developer experience. The current structure has a basic organization but could benefit from better separation of concerns and clearer patterns.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Current Structure:
   - Basic React + Vite setup with TailwindCSS
   - Components are divided into meetings, common, and spaces
   - Pages follow a similar structure with auth, spaces, and meetings
   - Using modern dependencies like Headless UI and Hero Icons
   - Has Supabase integration for backend communication

2. Areas for Improvement:
   - No clear distinction between layout components and feature components
   - Potential duplication between pages and components directories
   - Missing type checking (TypeScript could be beneficial)
   - No clear pattern for state management
   - Could benefit from better component composition patterns

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Setup and Structure Enhancement
   - [ ] Convert project to TypeScript for better type safety
   - Success Criteria: All .jsx files converted to .tsx, proper tsconfig.json setup

2. Directory Structure Reorganization
   - [ ] Reorganize src directory with following structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── assets/          # Static assets, images, icons
     ├── components/      # Shared components
     │   ├── ui/         # Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
     │   ├── layout/     # Layout components (header, footer, etc.)
     │   └── features/   # Feature-specific components
     ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
     ├── lib/            # Utility functions and constants
     ├── pages/          # Page components
     ├── services/       # API and external service integrations
     ├── styles/         # Global styles and Tailwind utilities
     └── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
     ```
   - Success Criteria: All files properly organized in new structure

3. Component Refactoring
   - [ ] Implement proper component composition patterns
   - [ ] Create reusable UI component library
   - Success Criteria: Components follow consistent patterns, reduced code duplication

4. State Management Enhancement
   - [ ] Implement proper context structure
   - [ ] Add proper loading and error states
   - Success Criteria: Clear state management pattern established

5. Code Quality Improvements
   - [ ] Add ESLint and Prettier configuration
   - [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
   - [ ] Add proper component documentation
   - Success Criteria: Linting rules established, documentation added

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Task 1: TypeScript Migration
- [ ] Task 2: Directory Restructuring
- [ ] Task 3: Component Refactoring
- [ ] Task 4: State Management
- [ ] Task 5: Code Quality Tools

## Lessons
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions
- Use TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- Follow component composition patterns for better reusability

2. **Meeting Transcripts** - Contains potentially sensitive conversations recorded in meetings

### High Priority (Recommended for encryption)
1. **Personal Information** - Username and other user profile data that could be used for identification
2. **Meeting Summary & Follow-ups** - May contain sensitive business decisions or action items
3. **Document Storage** - Particularly stored file names and paths which could reveal sensitive information

### Medium Priority (Consider encrypting)
3. **Topics & Poll Data** - Could contain sensitive voting information or discussion topics
